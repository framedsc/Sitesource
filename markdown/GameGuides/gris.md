## Tools

* [Cheat Engine Table by ghostinthecamera](..\CheatTables\ghostinthecamera-GRIS-timescale.CT)  
  This tool is used to pause the game. The default keybinds are `Numeric 0` to pause and `Numeric .` to play. You can also assign other keybinds to set the game speed to some intermediate values between 0 and 1 to get slow motion. To learn more, refer to this [Cheat Engine Table guide](https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/cheat_engine_tables.htm).

* [Free Camera by abarichello](https://github.com/abarichello/GRIS-free-camera)  
This tool unlocks the camera. Download the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file from the Releases tab, and place it inside `(Gris Installation Directory)/GRIS_Data/Managed` to overwrite the existing file. You can backup the original one or verify the game's integrity if you want it back.

## Notes
The in-game resolution settings caps out at your desktop resolution. If you want to play at higher resolutions (like 4K), set your desktop resolution to the corresponding value; only then the in-game settings show the higher resolutions. 

The game needs to be run in windowed mode for SRWE to hotsample properly.
