## Tips

@alert tip
**Turn Off Bloom and Chromatic Abberation**  
In video/graphics settings, turn off chromatic abberation and bloom. The bloom makes it look like a game from the bloom-vision hell of days past and the chromatic abberation is horrific.

## Tools

* [Camera Tools by ghostinthecamera](https://github.com/ghostinthecamera/IGCS-GITC)  
**Features**: Camera control, FOV Control.

@alert important
**Replay Mode Only**  
This camera is for use in replay mode and will only work in this mode.
@end

@alert info
**HUD Toggle and TImestop**  
Use the pause replay, slow motion and hide HUD features built into the replay mode.
@end

@alert info
**Camera Use**  
You can manipulate the camera while the replay is running. Bear in mind that the game doesn't know we have hijacked the camera. Therefore, if you leave the replay on the normal broadcast setting where it switches to helicopter and internal views, the game will change effects accordingly. Best to leave it on the fixed replay cameras (as these maintain the best smoke trail effects) and then activate the camera
@end

@alert info
**Video Use**  
If using the camera for video purposes, the camera angle you choose must be in roughly the same direction as the replay camera. I.e. if the replay camera is front on, then if you move this camera behind the car facing the back - dust/dirt clouds will disappear. Using Legacy Mode overcomes this issue - however, the dust/dirt clouds will not rotate to match the camera in this mode.

Use HOME and Numpad . to lock the camera and control the replay.
