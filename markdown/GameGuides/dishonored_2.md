## Tips and Tricks

### How to get a model of your player character (only works with Emily)

With the help of the Doppelganger power, you can spawn a doppelganger of Emily. Do remember that this doppelganger can only be summoned on a stable surface, and will rush to attack/distract enemies so it is best used in a cleared area. Also, powers might not work on certain levels, so be careful. 

It cannot change its position after being spawned i.e. it will face you once spawned, and will only turn its head to look at you. Quite useful for portraits or environment shots with a subject on them.

@alert warning
The Depth Buffer might break while hotsampling, especially in 1:1 AR. Also, depth buffers ingame and for the camera are different. Do recheck depth buffers after AR changes.
