##Additional Notes
* Install the contents of the HUD Toggle Zip file to "..\Steam\steamapps\common\DeadRising4". 
* By default the [Numpad_Decimal] key will toggle the game HUD. 
* The CE table will auto-attach to the game.
* Enable the camera script with [Page Dn] and use the keypad to move around. Use the mouse for camera rotation.
* Time control script is enabled with [Page Up]. Pause time with [P] and un-pause with [Shift]+[P]. Slomo can be set by pressing [Alt]+[X]. Note that depending on what is going on you run the risk of physics going absolutely bat shit crazy once time is restored back to normal. Everything not nailed down gets launched into the air like a tossed zombie salad. You have been warned!
* This may only occur on my setup but not all DSR resolutions would show up in the in-game menu selection. My go to 5120x2880 resolution did not show up in the list but I was able to get around this by selecting the nearest width 5120x2160 resolution that did work in fullscreen. In fullscreen this was 5120x2160 but when switching to windowed mode was able to get this to 5120x2880 by using SRWE. This may work with other DSR resolutions that do not show up in the in-game menu options.
