## Tools

* [No-Clip camera by Abarichello](https://github.com/abarichello/inside-noclip)
  This is a Cheat Engine table that unlocks the camera to allow it to move freely in the game's 2.5D space. Clone the repository or zip and extract to download the files. Follow the instructions on the Github page to use the tool.

## Notes

The in-game resolution settings caps out at your desktop resolution. If you want to play at higher resolutions (like 4K), set your desktop resolution to the corresponding value; only then the in-game settings show the higher resolutions.
