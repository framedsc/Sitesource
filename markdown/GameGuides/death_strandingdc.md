## Tips and Tricks

### Hotsampling

Hotsampling at higher than 3x resolution can cause the textures to glitch sometimes so wait a few seconds before taking the shot. Also keep an eye out for broken textures.

### Anisotropic Filtering

The game, by default, uses 4x filtering. Use the Nvidia Control Panel to set Anisotropic Filtering to 16x.
