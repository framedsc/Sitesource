* **Cheat Engine Table by Otis_Inf & HattiWatti**  
[DX11 Cheat Table](https://framedsc.github.io/CheatTables/Control_DX11_Otis.CT)  
[DX12 Cheat Table](https://framedsc.github.io/CheatTables/Control_DX12_Otis.CT)  
**Features**: Debug Camera, FOV, Time stop, Hotsampling, Hud Toggle, Render Toggles

## Using The CE Table 

First, [read the general Cheat Engine guide](https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/cheat_engine_tables.htm) if you have't already to learn how to use cheat engine tables (don't worry, it's easy).

All hotkeys are mentioned in the table, but here's some general info.

* **Debug Camera** - **`Insert`**  
The default speed is insanely fast, so use the mouse wheel to slow it down (or speed it up).  
The default rotation speed is perfect for controllers. If using a keyboard: Press `F9` after enabling the camera to slow the rotation speed for mice. `Numpad -/+` will change the camera FOV. 
* **Toggle Freeze** - **`Numpad 0`**
* **Toggle Hud** - **`Delete`**  
Press ESC twice to force the changes. This can be done while the game is frozen.

The render effect section contains some more useful toggles. Hotkeys for these are listed in the table.

## SRWE

To enable hotsampling (via SRWE) enable the hotsampling script. You may also need to check the `Force EXITSIZEMOVE` option in SRWE. 
Press `ESC` in-game in order to alt-tab to SRWE. After changing the resolution, alt-tab back to the game and press `ESC` again to force the game to update.
