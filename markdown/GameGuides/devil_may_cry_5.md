## Contact Shadows

To improve gameplay shadows on character models go to `Devil May Cry 5` game folder:
 
* Open the file `dmc5config.ini`.
* Change the `ContactShadowSetting` value from `CUSTOM` to `ON`.
* Save your changes, right click on the file -> properties.
* Select the "Read only" box.

It should also be noted that forcing contact shadows on gameplay may result in some texture bugs e.g., the balloons in mission 2 may look weird, among other things.

## Tips and Tricks

In order to use ReShade, you'll need the game to boot in DX11. In your game's folder, open `dmc5config.ini` and change the following line:

```TargetPlatform=DirectX11```
