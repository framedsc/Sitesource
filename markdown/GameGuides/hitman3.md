## ZHMModSDK Installation

1.  Click on the link above or click [here](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/ZHMModSDK/releases/tag/v1.6.0) and download the `ZHMModSDK-Release.zip` file. 

    @alert tip
    Make sure to download the version of the SDK which is compatible with your game version
    @end

2.  Extract the file and paste its contents in `Hitman 3\Retail` folder.

3. Download this [file](https://mega.nz/file/uDhiELDR#DkBbDhb5W-bKAMhGpkW4mQ0RICDQEfvYqz-1M5gn2pQ) and paste it in `Hitman 3\Retail` folder.

    **Alternatively** you can just create a new `text document`, rename it to `mods.ini`, paste this line in the file,
    ```
    [skipintro]
    ```
    save it and paste the file in the `Hitman 3\Retail` folder.

*This step is done because the SDK has a bug which causes the game to freeze at startup (4/5 times) so the `mods.ini` file activates `skipintro` mod which skips the game intro hence bypassing this bug.*

## Cheat Table

When you are *ingame* open the cheat table and select **Hitman 3** from the Processes. You need to press `Esc` once to make the Cheat Table work.

@alert important
The No HUD script does not hide the **Saving** box which shows up every few minutes
@end

## Using Freecam

The **ZHMModSDK** comes with some preinstalled mods including Freecam.
You can check the total list of mods from the [SDK repository](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/ZHMModSDK)

Once the above steps are done and you are in the *main menu/ingame*, press the `~` key to open up the console and select the **Freecam** and **Nopause** mods and click **OK**.

Disable the HUD using the CT. You can freeze/unfreeze the game using the `key 5`/`key 4`.

To enable the freecam make sure that the game is unpause and press `P`. This will show up the freecam controls for the first time which you can close by bringing up the cursor by pressing `~` key.

Once you have lined up the shot you can lock the camera by quickly unfreezing and pressing the `F3` key which locks the camera enabling Agent 47's movement and then freezing the game again
