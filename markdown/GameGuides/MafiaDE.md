### Reshade Depth Buffer
Because this game always runs in online mode you will not be able to use the depth buffer with the common reshade installer, you will need to use a custom build that doesn't block the use of reshade in online games. Find out more [here](https://framedsc.com/ReshadeGuides/setupreshade.htm#depth-buffer-on-online-games).

@alert info
Note that the game uses a reversed depth buffer. You will need to go to the global processor definitions and change `RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_IS_REVERSED` from `0` to `1`. This is essential and otherwise depth shaders will not work properly.
@end

### Scripthook and Reshade
If you are using Reshade alongside Scripthook, your game may no longer launch as Reshade hooks into the Scriphook launcher and interfers with the game. To fix this, edit `Mafia - Definitive Edition\ScriptHook\data\config.json` and change line 20 `"showStartupMenu"` from `true` to `false`.
