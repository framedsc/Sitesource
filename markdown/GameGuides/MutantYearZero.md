##Additional Notes
* Install the contents of the HUD Toggle Zip file to "..\Steam\steamapps\common\Mutant Year Zero\ZoneUE4\Binaries\Win64". 
* By default the [Caps Lock] key will toggle the pause menu HUD. You will need to be in the main menu (which conveniently pauses the game) and then press [Caps Lock] to disable the HUD. Press [Caps Lock] again to enable it.
* Hotsampling works with SRWE. Set the game to windowed fullscreen and change the resolution with SRWE.
* Disable startup movies by going to "..\Steam\steamapps\common\Mutant Year Zero\ZoneUE4\Content\Movies" and renaming the .mp4 files.
