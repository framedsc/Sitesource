<h1 id="cinematic-depth-of-field">Cinematic Depth of Field<a class="headerlink" href="#cinematic-depth-of-field" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
<p>Cinematic Depth of Field, or 'Cinematic DOF' is a <em>state of the art</em> Depth of Field shader for Reshade and is either available in the 
<a href="https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders" target="_blank">official Reshade repository</a> or in the 
<a href="https://github.com/FransBouma/OtisFX" target="_blank">OtisFX</a> repository. The OtisFX repository always contains the latest version. </p>
<p>This guide assumes you have <a href="../setupreshade.htm#checking-depth-buffer-access">properly set up the depth buffer in Reshade</a>.
Cinematic DOF is a depth of field shader which works with lens aspects for focusing and blur control. This might at first be confusing 
and this guide should help you understand what the various values mean and what to adjust to get the most out of this shader. </p>
<p>All settings in the Cinematic DOF shader are drag sliders, which means you can click them, hold the left-mousebutton and drag the mouse
left or right to resp. decrease and increase the value. By holding <code>shift</code> while dragging the increase/decrease will go faster. When holding
<code>ctrl</code> while clicking gives you the ability to type in the value you want. </p>
<h2 id="focusing">Focusing<a class="headerlink" href="#focusing" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<p>One of the most important parts of a depth of field shader is to focus on the right element in the 3D world. By default the 
shader has its focusing mode set to <em>auto-focus</em> and <em>mouse-driven auto-focus</em>. This means that if you mouse the mouse over the scene, the 
element that's below the mouse pointer will be the element the shader will focus on. Everything in front of it and behind it will be blurred.</p>
<p>This works for some situations, however if you want to set up the shot and alt-tab to a tool to increase the resolution of the screen for instance,
you'll lose your focus point. For those situations it's better to switch to <em>manual focusing</em>. To do so, simply <strong>uncheck</strong> the <em>Use auto-focus</em>
option in the Cinematic DOF settings in the Reshade menu. </p>
<p>When you switch to <em>manual focusing</em>, the shader will focus on a certain <em>distance</em> away from the camera. What that distance is, is specified in the
<strong>Manual-focus plane</strong> slider. To change the value, simply drag in the textbox till it has the value you want. </p>
<h3 id="distance-to-the-camera">Distance to the camera<a class="headerlink" href="#distance-to-the-camera" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>The element you have in-focus has a certain distance to the camera. The closer it is to the camera, so the closer the <em>focus plane</em> is to the camera, 
the stronger the blur will be in the out-of-focus areas. </p>
<h3 id="focusing-overlay">Focusing overlay<a class="headerlink" href="#focusing-overlay" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>Cinematic DOF has an important focus helper, its <em>out-of-focus plane overlay</em>. When the <strong>Show out-of-focus plane overlay on mouse down</strong> is checked,
the shader will show an overlay every time the left-mousebutton is pressed and hold down. The overlay consists of three colors: white for far plane 
(the area behind what's in focus) out of focus elements, red for near plane (the area in front of what's in focus) out of focus elements and a blue
line for what's exact in focus. </p>
<p>It also displays the <em>hyperfocal</em> area without any color, right next to the blue line. This area is considered 'in focus' 
but transitions slowly to 'out of focus'. When <em>auto-focus</em> is enabled, it will display a crosshair when the left-mouse button is pressed, with the auto-focus
point at the center of the crosshair. </p>
<p>It's recommended you use this option when setting up what to focus on. </p>
<h3 id="focal-length-and-aperture">Focal length and aperture<a class="headerlink" href="#focal-length-and-aperture" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>Cinematic DOF's focusing system is based on three elements: distance of focused element (focus plane) to the camera, the lens length (focal length) and the 
aperture. The distance to the camera is controllable by moving the camera closer to the subject (and with that re-focusing on the element in the 3D world 
you want to focus on). That leaves the focal length and the aperture. </p>
<p>For lens length, it in general means the longer the lens, the narrower the Field of View (FoV) and the more blur you'll get in out-of-focus areas. For aperture
in general it means the lower the value, the more open the lens will be, so the more light will come into the lens/camera, and with that the more blur you'll 
get in out-of-focus areas. For the Cinematic DOF shader, the two parameters are basically doing the same thing, as the shader itself doesn't control the amount of
light coming into the camera. </p>
<p>So what values should you pick? To get started, let's look at the defaults the shader comes with: 120mm for Focal length and 2.8 for aperture. If you'd use
a 120mm lens on a modern camera with aperture 2.8 you'd get nice portrait shots with a nice shallow depth of field and nice background blur. </p>
<p>Here's the default setting in action:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/focus_120mm_2_8.jpg" alt="120mm/2.8" title="120mm with 2.8 aperture" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>120mm with 2.8 aperture</p>
</div>
<p>Look careful at the blurring on the wings of the statue, and the thick blurring in the background. </p>
<p>If we change the lens and aperture to the values of a lens that's often sold with a modern camera, a 50mm lens with aperture 5.6, the results are a bit different:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/focus_50mm_5_6.jpg" alt="50mm/5.6" title="50mm with 5.6 aperture" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>50mm with 5.6 aperture</p>
</div>
<p>You can clearly see there's way less blur in the background. The focus is still on the statue, camera is still on the same distance. Also the blurring on the wings is gone, 
they're cleanly in focus.</p>
<p>Here's the same scene with a lens of 120mm and aperture of 5.6:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/focus_120mm_5_6.jpg" alt="120mm/5.6" title="120mm with 5.6 aperture" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>120mm with 5.6 aperture</p>
</div>
<p>And with a 50mm lens with aperture 2.8:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/focus_50mm_2_8.jpg" alt="50mm/5.6" title="50mm with 2.8 aperture" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>50mm with 2.8 aperture</p>
</div>
<p>There's subtle more blur than with a 5.6 aperture. You're free to choose what will give you the right blur factor. It's often only necessary to change one the 
two, either lens length <em>or</em> aperture, but not both. To get started, leave the aperture on 2.8 for now and only change the lens length to a lower value for less blur 
and a higher value for more blur. </p>
<div class="alert alert-tip"><span class="alert-title"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Tip</span><p>Moving the camera closer to the focused element also makes the blur be more prominent. </p>
</div><h2 id="blur-tweaking">Blur tweaking<a class="headerlink" href="#blur-tweaking" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<p>After you've set up the focus, the lens length and aperture, you can now tweak the blur of the near plane (in front of what's in focus) and the far plane (what's behind
what's in focus). Additionally you can change the quality of the blur and apply a post-blur smoothing factor to iron out any undersampling artifacts you might see. </p>
<p>Let's see what these look like. We'll use the defaults of 120mm and aperture of 2.8</p>
<h3 id="far-plane-blur">Far plane blur<a class="headerlink" href="#far-plane-blur" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>First we have <em>Far plane max blur</em>. Here you can tweak the blur strength given by the lens length + aperture + distance combination. A value of 1.0 gives the 
default blur for that combination. A value of 0 totally switches off bluring for the far plane. If you set the value to a high value, e.g. 3.0, you get excessive
blurring as seen in the shot below.</p>
<p>Far plane max blur set to 3.0:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_fp_3_0.jpg" alt="far plane blur 3.0" title="Far plane blur with blur set to 3.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Far plane blur with blur set to 3.0</p>
</div>
<p>If we change the blur to a lower value, e.g. 0.5, we'll get the result below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_fp_0_5.jpg" alt="far plane blur 0.5" title="Far plane blur with blur set to 0.5" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Far plane blur with blur set to 0.5</p>
</div>
<p>This might look the same as using a shorter lens, like 50mm, but that's not the case: with a 50mm lens the blur starts later, deeper into the 3D world, farther away from 
the focus plane. With 120mm the blur starts already on the wings of the statue. Because the blur factor is set to a lower value, the blur is very subtle. </p>
<h3 id="near-plane-blur">Near plane blur<a class="headerlink" href="#near-plane-blur" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>Additionally you can tweak the blur for the <em>near plane</em>. The near plane is blurred with a soft edge to make it realistic. The same applies to the near plane blur as 
for the far plane blur: setting it to 0 switches it off, setting it to a high value makes the blur extremely prominent. </p>
<p>Below an example shot where the focus is on the second pilar, using the default blur factor of 1.0 for both near and far plane.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_np_1_0.jpg" alt="near plane blur 1.0" title="Near plane blur with blur set to 1.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Near plane blur with blur set to 1.0</p>
</div>
<h3 id="overall-blur-quality-and-smoothing-factor.">Overall blur quality and smoothing factor.<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-blur-quality-and-smoothing-factor." title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>The overall blur quality is by default set to 5. This is the # of rings the shader will use per pixel to produce the disc-based blur. The higher the number, the more
rings and therefore the more samples it will take per pixel to blur the areas in the near and far plane. The value 5 gives overall good quality results and high performance
but if you want higher quality, you can, the range goes to 12. The higher the number, the more performance the shader will take. </p>
<p>A high quality number is in general only needed for highlights. In normal blurred areas without <em>bokeh</em> highlights, you won't notice much difference between e.g. 4 or 9.
However with a scene with a lot of bokeh highlights, you'll notice <em>dots</em> with low quality settings in highlights, if the blur factor is high enough. </p>
<p>See the following scene: </p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_q5.jpg" alt="Blur quality 5" title="Blur quality set to 5" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Blur quality set to 5</p>
</div>
<p>It has the quality set to the default, 5, and a high blur factor. The focus is on the stone fence in the front. You can see some dots in the bokeh highlights. If
we increase the quality to 8, as seen in the shot below, the dots are gone and we have smooth bokehs. </p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_q8.jpg" alt="Blur quality 8" title="Blur quality set to 8" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Blur quality set to 8</p>
</div>
<p>We can also achieve that with another option, the <strong>Post-blur smoothing factor</strong>. This setting applies a gaussian blur on the near and far plane to smooth out the 
highlights. It's a less subtle option than the quality setting, but the performance is better. </p>
<p>In the shot below the quality is back to the default, 5, but the smoothing factor is used to get rid of the undersampling artifacts instead.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/blur_q5_s.jpg" alt="Blur quality 5 smooth" title="Blur quality set to 5 with smoothing" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Blur quality set to 5 with smoothing</p>
</div>
<p>Not all artifacts are gone though: bokehs with low brightness are skipped to avoid blurring non-highlight areas. It's a trade-off and it's up to you what to use
in a particular scene.</p>
<h2 id="highlight-tweaking">Highlight tweaking<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-tweaking" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<p>A depth of field effect creates <em>bokeh</em> highlights, of which we've seen an example of in the previous section. Reshade is an SDR system, which means all rendering
it does is typically standard definition and not HDR. The downside of this is that with blurring highlights in the foreground and background, the energy isn't preserved
as much as with HDR systems. To help the shader get proper bokeh highlights, Cinematic DOF has a variety of settings which can help you create the bokehs you want. </p>
<h3 id="edge-bias">Edge bias<a class="headerlink" href="#edge-bias" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>A bokeh highlight is a typical round highlight with an even color. However you can change the round highlight to be a circle which is more transparent in the center
than it is on the edges. To do this, increase the <strong>Highlight edge bias</strong> to a value bigger than 0. The example below shows the highlights with an edge bias of 0.5.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_edgebias.jpg" alt="Highlight edge bias 0.5" title="Highlight edge bias of 0.5" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Highlight edge bias of 0.5</p>
</div>
<h3 id="highlight-type">Highlight type<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-type" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>There are different types of highlights. The default is <em>Twinkle circles</em> which gives the nice round colored highlight bokehs. However Cinematic DOF has another
highlight type, Bloom burn. It can give a more bloomy highlight without the typical round bokehs. An example of this is below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_bloomblur.jpg" alt="Bloom blur" title="Bloom blur highlight type" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="576" />
<p>Bloom blur highlight type</p>
</div>
<h3 id="highlight-gain">Highlight gain<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-gain" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>Both near and far plane have their own <strong>Highlight gain</strong>. This value controls how much of a boost the highlights get. Below you'll see a shot of
a scene in another Unreal Engine demo, SoulSlum, where there are a lot of background lights, and by default they still look quite weak:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_gain_off.jpg" alt="Highlight gain off" title="Highlight gain of 0.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Highlight gain of 0.0</p>
</div>
<p>However if we crank the Highlight gain of the far plane up to 1.0, we get a totally different scene:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_gain_1_0.jpg" alt="Highlight gain 1.0" title="Highlight gain of 1.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Highlight gain of 1.0</p>
</div>
<p>This might be a bit much however. There's another control you can use in tandem with the highlight gain, which is described in the next paragraph</p>
<h3 id="highlight-treshold">Highlight treshold<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-treshold" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>By default all highlights are boosted when you crank up the highlight gain of either near or far plane. This might be what you want, but it likely is a bit much. Also
in case of TAA/SMAA artifacts it might be you get highlight edges on your focused element because the framebuffer doesn't perfectly align with the depth buffer. </p>
<p>To tell the shader to only crank up the highlights above a certain brightness, you can use the <strong>Highlight treshold</strong> for both near plane and far plane. If it's set
to e.g. 0.3, all pixels which have a luminosity of 0.3 (0.0 being black, 1.0 being bright white) will be boosted. Below is an example shot with the same gain as above
but now also paired with a threshold of 0.7. All pixels which are brighter than 0.7 will get the gain applied, all other pixels are left alone. A lot less highlights are
visible, only the ones which are very bright.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_threshold.jpg" alt="Highlight threshold" title="Highlight threshold of 0.7 with gain of 1.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Highlight threshold of 0.7 with gain of 1.0</p>
</div>
<h3 id="highlight-normalization-for-far-plane">Highlight normalization for far plane<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-normalization-for-far-plane" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>The way the highlights are calculated depends on luminosity and the blur factor. This can lead to a loss in <em>light energy</em> around the edges of a bokeh highlight as 
things are calculated in SDR, not HDR. To make it look like everything was done in HDR and you get the well known circle highlights from photographs/cinema, the
shader comes with a normalization factor, which can correct this.</p>
<p>In the shot below we use little gain, a small threshold value and a normalization factor. This leads to nice circular bokehs in the far plane. </p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ht_normalized.jpg" alt="Highlight normalization" title="Highlight normalization of 0.5 with gain of 0.15 and threshold of 0.18" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Highlight normalization of 0.5 with gain of 0.15 and threshold of 0.18</p>
</div>
<p>The near plane doesn't have normalization as it doesn't need it: the blur system of the near plane works differently so highlights don't need normalization.</p>
<h2 id="anamorphism-control">Anamorphism control<a class="headerlink" href="#anamorphism-control" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<p>There are various lens effects known from cinema, one of them is anamorphic bokeh shapes, which means the bokeh shapes don't form perfect round circles around edges. 
Cinematic DoF offers three factors to control the anamorphic behavior of the bokeh shapes. </p>
<h3 id="anamorphic-factor">Anamorphic factor<a class="headerlink" href="#anamorphic-factor" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>The first factor is the factor to control of the anamorphism of the bokeh shapes, the <strong>Anamorphic factor</strong>. By default it's 1.0, which means all bokeh shapes are 
fine round circles. Moving the value down to 0.0 will make them appear more and more line elipses. Below is an example of a scene with an anamorphic factor of 0.7. 
It shows slight deformation around the edges, but close to the center the shapes are still round.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ana_factor.jpg" alt="Anamorphic factor" title="Anamorphic factor of 0.7" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Anamorphic factor of 0.7</p>
</div>
<h3 id="anamorphic-spread-factor">Anamorphic spread factor<a class="headerlink" href="#anamorphic-spread-factor" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>The default spread factor makes the anamorphism appear to the edges, not in the center. To make it show up evenly everywhere, you can increase the <strong>Anamorphic spread factor</strong>
to a value higher than 0.0, with 1.0 being the factor where the anamorphism is applied everywhere evenly. An example of that is given below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../Images/ShaderGuides/CinematicDOF/ana_spreadfactor.jpg" alt="Anamorphic spread factor" title="Anamorphic factor of 0.7 with spread factor of 1.0" class="shadowed" width="1024" height="640" />
<p>Anamorphic factor of 0.7 with spread factor of 1.0</p>
</div>
<h3 id="anamorphic-alignment-factor">Anamorphic alignment factor<a class="headerlink" href="#anamorphic-alignment-factor" title="Permalink to this headline"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
<p>Not everyone wants the anamorphism to rotate around the center. If you for instance want the anamorphism to appear more vertical, you can tweak the <strong>Anamorphic alignment factor</strong>
